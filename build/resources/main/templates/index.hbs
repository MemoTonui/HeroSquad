<h1 class=" text-center">HERO SQUAD</h1> <hr>
        <p>A real hero is someone who gets up even when he can't. ... 
          We do not have to become heroes overnight. Just a step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up ... 
          discovering we have the strength to stare it down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you know anyone worthy of this title?
            Here is your chance to make your own Heros regardless of whether they can fly or not.
